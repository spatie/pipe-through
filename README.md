The `take` function allows you to perform a sequence of operations on any object without needing to create intermediate variables and without needing to worry about `null` or `undefined` values.

        .then(string => string.toUpperCase())

        .withDefault(ðŸ˜¢);

fourthLetterInUpperCase('hello'); // 'L'
fourthLetterInUpperCase('foo'); // 'ðŸ˜¢'
```
